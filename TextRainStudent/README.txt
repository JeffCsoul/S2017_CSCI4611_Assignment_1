Description:
  1) For generating new text, my program would use the random function twice. In the first time, it would generate a random real number between 0.0 and 2.0. If the value is less than 1, it would generate lower letter, otherwise capital letter. Then it would generate an integer from 0 to 25 and my program would take this integer to generate corresponding lower or capital letter.
  2) I designed a class for describing letters. This actually help design the related functions and draw the letter more easily.
  3) For deciding which movement a letter should go, I used four detecting points. A point is located on the mid-bottom. This point is used to detect whether this letter should continue to go down. Another point is located inside the letter and this point is used to detect whether this letter should be force to go up since the pressure of black area. Two points are located on the left-down side and the right-down side. These two points are used to decide whether the letter should go left or right. These four detecting points help implement the falling function for letters.
  4) I use a global variable to calculate out the runtime for calling draw function once and use this time period divided by 50 as a factor to generate the speed for a specified letter. By the speed generated by the time factor, we can control that speeds for letters' falling down are identical on different machine.
